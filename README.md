# CRUD GitHub

This is a test project that uses GitHub's API via Octokit and Clerk for authentication.  
It fetches all repositories the authenticated user has access to (including private ones) and filters them by name — specifically repositories that start with **"CRUD"**.

## Features

- 🔐 Authenticated access using [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/)
- 🐙 GitHub integration using [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js)
- 🛠️ Foundation for CRUD operations and repo management
